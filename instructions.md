# Create Pixel-Perfect Responsive Landing Page

Create a pixel-perfect, fullscreen responsive landing page that exactly matches the provided screenshot. Requirements:

## Technical Stack
- Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript ONLY
- No frameworks, libraries, or preprocessors
- Clean, semantic markup with accessibility considerations

## Layout & Design
- **Three-column layout:** left sidebar navigation + two main content columns
- **Column 1:** Sidebar with navigation menu
- **Column 2:** Hero image (microscopic/cellular structure) with statistics section below
- **Column 3:** Main content area with headline, descriptive text, and CTA button
- **Prominent vertical dividers/separators** between each column section - these are clearly visible and essential to the design
- **Horizontal dividers** separating content sections within columns
- Dark teal/green color scheme matching the original
- Typography and spacing must be identical
- Clean, structured grid with clear visual separation between sections

## Navigation Structure
- Left sidebar with menu items: HOME, RESEARCH, TEAM, THE LAB, ABOUT, CONTACT
- MYC Laboratory logo at top
- Clean, minimal navigation styling

## Content Areas
- **Header:** "SCIENCE CAN CHANGE OUR FUTURE!" (exact typography)
- **Subheading:** "We are the only lab to use new methods to identify diseases"
- **Statistics section:** "89% EFFECTIVENESS" and "2356 NEW TESTS"
- **Lorem ipsum paragraph** with "READ MORE" button
- **Weather placeholder:** Replace "Location: city temp" with static placeholder text showing "Location: [City Name], Temperature: [XX]Â°C" for future API integration

## Visual Elements
- Implement prominent divider lines exactly as shown in screenshot
- Vertical separators between columns
- Horizontal separators between content sections
- Consistent divider styling and positioning
- Ensure dividers maintain visual hierarchy and spacing
- Microscopic image appears to show cellular/molecular structure

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach for screens < 1000px
- Sidebar collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- Content reflows to single column layout
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing
- Maintain visual hierarchy on all screen sizes
- Preserve divider functionality in mobile view

## Code Organization
- Component-based HTML structure with clear comments
- Modular CSS with logical grouping
- Clean JavaScript for mobile menu functionality
- Semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, etc.)
- BEM or similar naming convention for CSS classes

## Deliverables
1. Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS
2. Pixel-perfect desktop version (1200px+ screens)
3. Mobile-optimized version (< 1000px screens)
4. Clean, commented code ready for weather API integration

**Focus on clean, maintainable code that exactly replicates the visual design while being fully responsive and accessible.**
